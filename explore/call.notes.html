<li> contracted slot questions; 1 child enrolled one active
<li> HelloI am currently on a contracted slot for my son at the YMCA for full time childcare.  I am due to have another child in November and plan to return to my full time job in Early February 2017.  I was told by the childcare director they do not have a spot for my second child under the contracted slots.  The only options are a voucher or to pay the full time rate which I cannot afford.  Could you please provide me with information as to how to get a voucher for my second child?  I applied for the wait list when my son was born in 2011 but never heard anything.  Please help!  I am desperate and have no other options I need to return to work in February.  Thank youKelly ShaughnessyHi Kelly:?Please contact Mass211 by phone (2-1-1) to update your wait list record. We will also add your unborn child. Based on what you have written--your baby would receive a priority status (sibling) and if no contracted slot is available you may be able to access a voucher through your CCR&R when needed.LynneMass211

<li> I'm seeking after school childcare on behalf of one of my clients who is living in 02131. The childcare would be for a 9 year old boy in the public school system, who is from a single parent household and his mother is unemployed.  Do you have free or reduced-fee after school programs in that area? Perhaps childcare centers that offer scholarships for folks who are homeless or low-income? The purpose of the childcare is so that his mother can begin working. I think part of my question is about looking for more information about EEC's wait list, like what benefits are provided, what the average wait-time is, and how to get on the waitlist. I tried sifting through the state's website on it but it was difficult to parse out. Any light you could shed on these things would be so helpful!Brittany Mitchell Clinical Social Work InternYouthConnect 115 Warren StBoston, MA Cell: 617-898-7673Office: 617-516-5406Fax: 617-442-1705www.bgcb.org

<li> My name is Kimberly Godden I am a 27 year old single mother of 2 amazing boys Connor age 6 and Brayden almost 2 years old... i am reaching out because I came across your website while searching for Christmas help around Marlborough ma... The thing is im actually just looking into any help..Almost a year ago I lost all our belongings due to my apartment flooding and the management discriminating against my disabled son because I pressed charges on a landscaper that worked for them for inappropriately touching him... after I got a restraining order they refused to do anything to help me and tried to evict me until the police stepped in telling them they could not do that, than my apartment flooded and they refused to replace carpets and everything we literally have been bouncing around for an entire year but FINALLY on Dec 3rdwe will be moving into our new apartment that I was luckily able to secure just days before my section 8 expired... So after a long years of ups n mostly downs we will finally have a home again... the problem is I have not one thing to put in our home and its DECEMBER we have no tree and figuring out what they will sleep on is kind of the major concern im so afraid both my kids will have a roof over their heads but no Christmas at such a seriously important age where xmas is supposed to be magical but also the way things look right now the most my 2 year old will get as a birthday is a cake... i know he's only 2 but it still breaks my heart... they are both so amazing and deserve the world... I've been unable to work for the past 8 years when I was put on bed rest and since then my son had a especially difficult first 5 years being in n out of the hospital due to uncontrollable epilepsy around age 5 the seizures stopped but now he suffers for pretty severe developmental delays and behavior issues so even if I attempted to work it wouldn't last I am unreliable due to constant appts with therapy and stuff with him on top of having an active toddler... I know i just threw EVERYTHING  out there and I really want you to know I hate looking like a begger... i never go into details about my struggles but as December approaches I'm terrified and desperate so I figure even if u can't help me maybe you have some resources you could educate me on so I can try to make this be a double magical moment for them I'd love to have them wake up on xmas morning in there own home finally and also have a magical christmas... Merry Christmas!! God bless!! You can contact me here or my phone number is 508-740-0842 Thank you, Kimberly Godden

<li> Dear United WayI am 64 and a half. I live in Marlborough Ma.I have a 17 year old son a 19 year old son.Someone mentioned to contact United Way forhelp looking. My 1997 year old van which I have had from the beginninghas died. My transmission gave out and I can no longer drivethe van. My 17 year old son was in the middle of a yearof learning how to drive and this sudden loss of car isextremely sad and overwhelming for him being a teenager. My husband has no license. He had to go to jailten years ago for a DUI for four years and it was revoked.  He has a bad hipa bad heart and has around 60 percent hearing loss.I have to drive him wherever he goes. Because of his health issuesI had to start collecting my social security in July this year becausehe can no longer work as a carpenter.Also, my mom 86  who has dementia/severe Alzheimers, and my 87 year old father need me to take them todoctor visits. I am on SNAP and Mass Health. I do not have the money to buy another car.I heard from somewhere that Massachusetts has or had a program or programsto enable low income people who struggle to get a car. I do not need another vanbecause my children are older. Would you be able to tell me where tolook as if there is an organization to help. It would be great if you could direct me. God Bless. Thank you very much.Laurie Buckley

<li> Hi Lynne, It would be good to send her a letter since the other record had been terminated for a while and the notes from Mass211 say that she is desperate for a voucher.  If she owes money, she also will not be allowed to start on a DTA referral until the balance is paid.  For that very reason, I have copied Yoely to flag this household for her.Thanks,CaroleRE:: ZAINAB MANSARAY This family got funding after a note on a terminated duplicate record from CTI said to contact them first...I terminated the 2nd record today...do I need to send a letter letting them know they have a balance with CTI? Thanks, Lynne

<li> I was encouraged to contact a variety organizations like yours to see if you all can assist with this past rent monies that we owed to our previous landlord, Joseph Taylor. We were grateful that he allowed me and my kids to move in four years ago from Maryland with only SS incomes.  My second son s Deaf and Autism who was rejected at Deaf school in Florida after my divorce with his father. My parents lived there that would be helpful for me and my children.  After being rejected at Florida School for the Deaf, we moved to Maryland where my son s father remarried, unfortunately Maryland School for the Deaf did not have trained teachers/staff to work with Deaf Autism.  It was when we had to move back to Framingham- Learning Center for the Deaf children/now it s called Marie Philip School.  MPS has had years of experience with Deaf Students on Autism Spectrum and my son was one of their students in Parent Infant Program/Elementary school.  My son is doing well since we moved back.  We were always on hardship with living. All of us are on Social Security Disability income, and has had numerous support through Welfare system for food and health resources even are regular Food Pantry goers.  We are fortunate to got the home at Framingham Housing Authority here in Musterfield Court past July 2016.  The rent is more suitable for my income and that we can afford to live here.  Our former landlord was kind not to evict us but he hoped that we would be able to pay him back.  If you can please email me on how you can support or refer our letter in support for this rent to be paid off.  Landlord is Joseph Taylor. His phone number is at 508-277-5552.  His wife Lisa s the accountant who has the exact amount of owed rent monies.  Pls email me at clemmey4@gmail.com to let me know how you can support/or refer or any resources u think I can try to ask for help with old rent monies.  Thank you Heidi ClemmeyMother of 3

<li> Cheryl,Thank you for all your effort to try and straighten out this mess we have been dealing with.  Your recommendation is completely correct.

<li> Thanks for keeping up with this.  Cheryl is making every effort to facilitate the transfer for Ms. Felix from her contracted slot in Boston to a voucher out of Child Care Resources in Worcester.  Unfortunately, Ms. Felix's last provider has not provided requested documentation in a timely manner so it has held up the process for Ms. Felix.  Also, Cheryl is currently playing phone tag with Ms. Felix's employer, Nick Andolfo or Til as Ms. Felix is unable to provide paystubs or confirmation of her employment as well as her income.  Ms. Felix has a dual service need of employment and education.   I have cc'd Ms. Felix on this so that we are all on the same page.  Cheryl will be following up with both Ms. Felix and myself once she is able to speak with Mr. Andolfo.Please feel free to reach out if anyone has any additional questions at this time.As always, I thank you for your assistance in these efforts.TaraTara O'Brien McNally, Financial Assistance Policy Analyst

<li> CONFIDENTIAL Pam transferred the call to me as she was confused why the child is enrolled with Nurtury is she is getting a voucher at CCR. Mother said she doesn't understand what hold up is with voucher. She was crying. She said she got her paperwork into Cheryl. She repeated her child has been violated (which she also said to Pam, I learned later after asking Pam to call me back). She said she doesn't have a safe place for her while she is waiting for voucher. I asked her to tell me more, is she referring to child abuse/molestation? She said her daughter was touched. I replied, I encourage you to contact DCF to report it, she said she did not want the number nor did she want to discuss it with me, that she just wants to know when she will get the voucher. I REPORTED THIS TO DCF Caitlyn 508-424-0100 and faxed the report over.

<li> I don't believe that the parent didn't talk to Beverly Children's Learning Center based on the notes.  However, I can understand how Pamela might have gotten confused when the mother told her that she was enrolled elsewhere and may not have realized that while the children are enrolled, the mother still wants to be active on the waitlist for a subsidy.  Therefore, you can give the mother back an application date of 8/18/15. That being said, you may want to advise the parent that there are likely not going to be any no new vouchers available this year, so if she is looking for a subsidy to stay at her current program and that program is not a contracted provider, she may be out of luck.  No matter what, her preference should be added to the notes so that she does not receive funding letters that she is not going to accept.

<li> Deena received a Kinder Wait application from this family on September 29th  that listed income totaling $4,277.00 monthly.  This amount makes the family eligible for the wait list.  It looks like either Deena didn't change the income in Kinder Wait or it didn't save when she edited the record.  The correct income is in the family record at this time.  Unless I hear something differently from you, I'll have my staff person put the family's record back to active (and follow up with the family) when she is back in the office on Tuesday.  Let me know if I missed something though.Sorry for the confusion -Hi Beth:Sareta spoke to her on 10/5/16, which is when we sent the most recent termination. Their income is above the FY17 amount for a family of 4: $4541. KW lists them at $4749, so they are reporting differently to us; I have sent this family 3 termination letters since 8/3/16. They get back on wait list, then call us and are over-income.Since she spoke to us afterward, let's leave terminated as the letter will tell her to contact us.Thanks and have a nice weekend!Lynne

Was in the process of explaining that app can be reactivated to last app date if response is confirmed by SMOC but the call dropped. I put all notes in KW.

<li> Cleonice called again asking to renew KW application #447987. I once again explained that we cannot discuss information without her husband adding her to the application first. She stated she would have him call us. Upon further investigation it appears that Cleonice was added to the WL by Child Care Resources on 8/10/16 as the sole parent. Per KW notes from CCR she states that her husband does not live with her and that he only helps her out financially. Both applications have the same address. Child's name is spelled differently in CCR application which explains why duplicate error did not pop up for them. Noted both KW apps and Lynne will follow up by trying to reach Cleonice for clarification.
<li> 661797 Nathan When the call disconnected it rang and then a hold message for an Extended Stay Hotel in Baltimore began playing.

<li> Received call on RAP line from Erin Greenow (413-733-6661), crisis supervisor from Behavioral Health Network in Springfield.  She was calling to let us know that three siblings from Springfield showed up to the BHN offices saying that they needed somewhere to go because they were afraid their mother was going to hurt them.  She was wondering if this was a RAP call.  Mass211 advised her that RAP are initiated by law enforcement.  One of the children (Nyasia Atkins, 12 years old) was involved in a RAP case earlier this week.  Child reports she was placed in a foster home for a few days and then returned home.  Other children involved are 9 year old Eliana Atkins and 6 year old Jacob Atkins.  Greenow stated that BHN would probably not be doing an evaluation and that she would be contacting the DCF Hotline.
<li> I have called twice and I'm not hearing back from anyone.  I am due to have my second child in November and return to work Mid-February.

<li> Dear Charesse:Please call Mass211, at 2-1-1; at prompt, choose 23 for a child care specialist. I cannot find your application for the centralized wait list. Child care is subsidized by the state: Dept. of Early Education and Care (EEC), not Child Care Aware. We can tell you more about how the subsidy system works when you call in.We'd like to gather more information in order to find referrals to match what you need in a child care program.Thanks,-- LynneMass211 Information & Referral SpecialistDial 2-1-1 I will be moving into the Planeville, Norfolk, Wrentham area within the next couple of months and have a 3-year old daughter.  Could I please get a list of daycare centers/pre-schools that are subsidized by Child Care Aware?  Thanks Charesse BloodFamily ID#: 493254

<li> From: Tammy Venterosa <tventerosa@me.com>Date: Mon, Aug 8, 2016 at 5:37 AMSubject: AssistanceTo: info@mass211.org <info@mass211.org>HiI/we are currently residents of Norwood MassI'm a disabled low income single mother of three and I'm trying to figure out who I can contact to get an application assistance for child care for my 2 year old son. Any information you can give me would be greatly appreciatedThank youTammy
<li> Caller is looking for resources on possible parental kidnapping. Caller's husband took son to Africa and has not returned. I gave her the missing children national hotline for help with I&R on international cases. Caller had to go back to work but if she calls back, she would like legal aid and her local DCF phone number to call on Monday.
<li> I just wanted you to be aware of a caller, Martha Thomson.  HH ID  374198.  She had her daughter call earlier but Neida told her we needed to talk to her.  App was termed 1/22/2016.   I started updating info and what she told me about income made her way over.  No special needs, no military.  Mom then tried to tell me it was a different amount.  She was still over.  She asked what guideline is for family of 2 so I told her.  She said Just put that in then, I'm guessing (BUT her original answer was I make $48000 a year) She had been termed previously for being over income.  I advised her to try to find a pay stub or tax return and call us back.  She then asked to add her mom to the app as she sometimes stays with her for medical treatment.  Her mom is not a citizen and she does NOT claim her on her taxes.  I again said I cannot do that. I put these notes in both iC and KW.  I just wanted you to be aware because she basically was trying to figure out a way to get back on the w/l and I don't think she is going to be truthful when she calls back (which i know is an issue for CCR)

<li> No referrals given
<li> sent paperwork to Pam so she can call father back
<li> term letter sent
<li> Thank you for looking into this.  We would absolutely pay for the time that the child was attending - continuity of care is really at the child level, not the parent/guardian level.   The key thing is that we always want CCFA to correctly reflect where the child is at, both what program and also who has guardianship.  That being said, for ease of everyone, the placement and household can remain as is.  The only thing we would ask is that you add notes to the household saying that custody went to the father on 4/26/16 but child continued attending and EEC allowed authorization to remain as is. Even though it has been slightly longer than 30 days, we will allow the father to be assessed for IE eligibility (we can't give him DTA-PT that the mother would have been eligible for).  Please reach out to him to set this up.  If you have any questions, please let me know. Lynne - can you send them the father's contact information?
<li> VIVIAN BARRETO reports she did not get the funding letter last July, she had spoken to us just before notification. She is requesting her last application date. Can you please tell me if that letter was sent?
<li> she spoke to Lesley but dialed wrong prompt and is not in KW, so I left vcml but have no demo for this call
<li> rest of info is unknown, referred by Kat for WL, but she gets cash-will c/b if worker says no auth, for us to take new app.
<li> Hi Lynne, I checked in CCFA and Alyana has not had an active authorization since September 2015.  However, 431621 should be updated with the rest of the household members because it has all the history.  It is also the household listed in CCFA (CCFA has all of the children listed).  Once that is done, 463795 should be deleted since there is no history beyond recent. Beth - I am copying you to flag this issue for you.  Violeta Wells at Child Care Network added the household as new when the father was already on the waitlist with one of the children. Thanks all,Carole
<li> Kalee took this call on Friday, listed as general public, but she is on the wait list. We sent this email with referrals as she was asking for 8:30 pm pick up (does she need that? what is her schedule?) Please ask these questions and update her entire record on WL as Jaden is still listed with HCS Head Start, maybe he should be active with CoC, depending on her activity at this time, is she IE?Please contact us at 2-1-1: We would like to update your wait list recordcheck your work scheduleget the name of the school Jaden will attend for kindergarten. (We have searched providers for flexible schedule--you can ask about late pick-up, as well as before and after school hours.)

<li> Good afternoon, I am currently seeking childcare for my two children, ages 2 and 4 as soon as possible. I am a single mother. I make $640-$660 a week. I am $21.00 over the income eligibility guideline for vouchers. I can't afford much, my rent alone is $1200, and I have no family in the area AT ALL. Their father left us and has since moved out of state, providing no support. I am desperate, or else I am facing resignation of my current employment as my next option. My daughter is 2.4 months. My son just turned 4 years old. I worked through ever referral I received from you folks, and I am running into an issue where slots are not available until September, or a slot is available for one and not the other, or it would cost me $500 a week to send them, or they won't except my daughter unless she is 2.9 months. No one is offering scholarships. No one is offering a sliding scale. All I've encountered is 10% sibling discount. I need HELP in the worse! Please, if someone could get back to me as soon as possible, I'd greatly appreciate it! Meaghan Chambers857-236-5989

The parent tells me that she never resided at the address the letter had been sent to. Thanks! David T. Bessette, Financial Assistance Specialist
