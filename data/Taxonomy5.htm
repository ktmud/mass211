The common house serves as the social center for the community and typically includes a common kitchen, dining area, sitting area, children's playroom and laundry, and also may contain a workshop, library, exercise room, crafts room and/or one or two guest rooms. Residents manage their own cohousing communities, and also perform much of the work required to maintain the property.

            <td valign="top">A housing option that involves neither a rental nor a purchase but a hybrid arrangement under which residents pay for the right to occupy a unit, usually a townhouse or a suite, and access to all common areas and facilities. Residents own the leasehold interest in the unit, but not the unit itself. Life lease units are generally priced lower than comparable market rate housing options and owners pay a monthly fee to cover expenses such as maintenance and management. A life lease can be for the life of the tenant or for a specific term (e.g. 50 years), and some have no specified termination date. The majority of life lease communities are developed and owned by nonprofit organizations, charitable groups, service clubs or religious institutions. When a resident leaves or passes away, the lease can usually be sold to someone on the sponsor's waiting list or on the open market, or transferred back to the development's sponsoring organization. Some life lease agreements permit the interest to be passed to the resident's family through their will. Conditions of this right of transfer are determined by the organization that establishes the life lease project. Most sponsors, in consultation with the residents, restrict who can live in the building (e.g., a minimum age of 55) to ensure that the integrity of the community is maintained. Some properties, particularly those that target people with moderate and low incomes, have maximum income level limits and/or limits on total assets.</td>

Lower turnover rates, lower real estate tax assessments (in some local areas), controlled maintenance costs, and resident participation and control are some of the benefits of choosing cooperative homeownership.

In some cases, a "transition in place" option allows families to continue living in the same complex (if not the same unit) where their transitional housing unit is located when they are ready to move to permanent housing. In other cases, the permanent housing option is either public housing or private rental housing supported by a tenant-based voucher subsidy.

Models include case-defined reentry courts where a sentencing judge can retain jurisdiction over a case during the entire life of the sentence; and reentry courts that are established as stand-alone courts where the court maintains an exclusive docket of reentry cases.

Defendants convicted of less serious crimes may be sentenced to simple probation, i.e., supervision in the community under the direction of a probation officer. For other crimes, a judge may choose from three intermediate sanctions: community confinement, intermittent confinement, and home detention. For more serious crimes, judges may impose a split sentence, in which the defendant spends a short time in prison and the remainder of the sentence in one of the intermediate sanctions. Community confinement means residence in a treatment center outside the prison walls, such as a halfway house or drug rehabilitation center. Community confinement may be imposed instead of prison time, or as a means of easing transition back into the community after time spent in prison. Intermittent confinement means the defendant is free to go to work or live at home for part of the week, but must spend time in jail on weekends. Home confinement is a judicially managed system of punishment and control for offenders deemed safe enough to live in their own homes, but requiring a higher degree of supervision.</td>

The marketplaces enable individuals and small employers to compare available private health insurance options on the basis of price, benefits and services, quality and other factors; and are required to provide for the operation of a toll-free call center and an Internet website as consumer assistance tools. They help enhance competition in the health insurance market, provide a range of affordable health insurance choices and give small businesses the same purchasing power as large businesses. They serve as a one-stop shop where individuals can get information about their options; be assessed for premium assistance subsidies (tax credits) which are determined on a sliding scale and cost sharing assistance subsidies; and be assessed for or enrolled in the plan of their choice. The marketplaces are not insurers, so they do not bear risk themselves, but determine the insurance companies that are allowed to participate in them. Health plans provided through the marketplaces are made available to qualified employers and their employees in the small group market through a small business health options program (SHOP).</td>

High risk pools charge a higher premium, typically 125 to 200 percent of the average premium for individual health insurance on the open market, and vary the premium based on the individual’s age and other factors. People apply for high-risk pool coverage through an insurance agent or directly with the state, generally have a choice of health plan options, and once enrolled, use their benefits just like any other consumer of private insurance coverage.

In many cases, parental rights are transferred to an adoption agency rather than directly to new adoptive parents so that the agency can maintain the level of confidentiality and privacy that the parties desire and have agreed to in the adoption. The agency passes the parental rights to the adopting parents. Laws governing consent and relinquishment vary by jurisdiction. In some areas, relinquishment is a judicial process, taking place in court; in others, papers can be signed in front of agency representatives, a notary, or other designated person. Other differences include whether relinquishment terminates parental rights or is just part of the process, whether relinquishment papers can be signed prior to the birth of the child or within a specified time following birth, the conditions under which relinquishment can be revoked, and the conditions under which a pending adoption may be interrupted beyond the time allowed for revocation.

Typically a case worker meets with immediate family members to identify the larger family unit to participate in the process, and a neutral coordinator works with the family as they discuss issues and options. Then the family works privately to develop a plan of action. People involved in the process may include parents, grandparents, other kin, children, tribal elders (where relevant) and individuals whom the family considers to be supportive (e.g., neighbors, clergy). In most instances, families participate in family group conferencing on a voluntary basis, though in a few locations, meetings are court-ordered.

The family is prepared and supported as they transition from formal services to independence.

Included are programs for individuals who are proficient in American Sign Language (ASL), Quebec Sign Language (LSQ) as well as those who use systems like Signed Exact English (SEE), Conceptually Accurate Signed English (CASE) which involve manually coded English, signed French which involve manually coded French, cued speech in which words spoken by lips are supplemented by cues which aid speech reading, and oral transliteration in which words spoken by an individual are silently mouthed to the deaf person accompanied by appropriate facial expressions and gestures to facilitate conveyance of the information. Sign language interpreters interpret in two ways: voice-to-sign and sign-to-voice. Voice-to-sign means the interpreter is signing to the deaf person what the speaker is saying. Sign-to-voice means the interpreter is voicing to the hearing person what the deaf person is signing. Some individuals want an interpreter who can perform both roles. Others prefer to speak for themselves and limit the interpreter's role to signing to them.</td>

            <td valign="top">Programs that allow people who are deaf, hard of hearing or have speech impairments to communicate through a communications assistant with people who use a standard telephone or the Internet. The communications assistant relays TTY (text telephone or telecommunications device for deaf and hard of hearing individuals) to the telephone user and types that person's response back to the TTY user. Three options when using a telephone relay service are voice carry-over (VCO), hearing carry-over (HCO) and speech-to-speech (STS).  VCO allows a person with a hearing impairment to speak directly to the other party and then read the response typed by a communications assistant. HCO allows a person with a speech impairment to hear the other party and relay the TTY response back to the telephone user through the communications assistant. STS provides assistance for people with speech disabilities who have difficulty being understood on the phone. STS communications assistants are specially trained in understanding a variety of speech disorders, which enables them to repeat what the caller says in a manner that makes the caller’s words clear and understandable to the called party. The relay service allows individuals with communication disorders to communicate with all telephone users. Telecommunication relay services can be reached by dialing 711. </td>

Principal concepts include the role of primal archetypes, which are universal and arise from the collective unconscious, as guiding forces in human behavior; and the bipolar nature of the human mind which looks at individuals in terms of introversion/extroversion dimensions, the thinking, feeling, sensing and intuiting focus of mental activity, and the masculine/feminine dimensions of the psyche. The role of the therapist is to bring to consciousness the repressed side of the psyche and to strengthen those facets as a means of enriching the individual's life. The therapist uses dream analysis as a primary mechanism for understanding the individual's current problems and future aspirations.</td>

Multimodal therapy transcends the behavioral tradition by dealing in great depth with sensory, imagery, cognitive and interpersonal factors and their interactive effects. The task of the therapist is to develop the unique set of interventions that is appropriate for each individual based on a multimodal assessment of his or her temperament and personality. Assessments and interventions are structured around the seven modalities which are summarized by the acronym BASIC I.D.: behavior, affect, sensation, imagery, cognition, interpersonal relationships and drugs and biological factors.</td>

ACT teams provide nearly all of the treatment and members work collaboratively as a team with blended roles, not as a group of individual practitioners who operate with primary responsibilities of their own. ACT community and clinical services are guided by the consumers' strengths and preferences, an assertive approach, individually tailored programming, ongoing monitoring, variable support, in vivo service, relating to consumers as responsible citizens, direct availability 24 hours per day, utilizing a variety of community resources and collaborating with the family. The ACT model is also known as the Program of Assertive Community Treatment or PACT.</td>

Music therapists assess emotional well-being, physical health, social functioning, communication abilities, and cognitive skills through musical responses; and design music sessions for individuals and groups based on client needs using music improvisation, receptive music listening, song writing, lyric discussion, music and imagery, music performance and learning through music. Music can thus be used as a passive agent as in the case of listening to music to aid in reminiscence, reality orientation or relaxation; or as an active creative process in which the individual participates in musical production. Through musical involvement in the therapeutic context, clients' abilities are strengthened and transferred to other areas of their lives.

Medication assisted maintenance treatment (MAT) may be provided in an outpatient treatment program (OTP) or OTP unit such as a pharmacy or physician's office, or for buprernorphine products (Bunavail, Suboxone, Subutex, Zubslov), a physician's office or other health care setting.

            <td valign="top">Medication assisted treatment (MAT) programs that use buprenorphin to help people with an opioid use disorder abstain from or reduce their use of opioids (usually heroin or painkillers such as oxycondin or morphine). Buprenorphine produces a weaker version of effects (including euphoria and respiratory depression) that are associated with full drugs such as heroin and methadone. The effects increase with each dose until at moderate doses they level off, lowering the risk of misuse, dependency and side effects. Treatment occurs in three phases: a medically monitored start-up phase when the patient is in early stages of withdrawal; a stabilization phase after a patient has discontinued or greatly reduced their misuse of the problem drug, no longer has cravings, and experiences few, if any, side effects; and a maintenance phase when a patient is doing well on a steady dose of buprenorphine. The length of time of the maintenance phase is tailored to each patient and could be indefinite. Once an individual is stabilized, an alternative approach would be to go into a medically supervised withdrawal, which makes the transition from a physically dependent state smoother. People then can engage in further rehabilitation—with or without MAT—to prevent a possible relapse. Ideal candidates for opioid dependency treatment with buprenorphine have an opioid use disorder diagnosis, are willing to follow safety precautions for the treatment, have been cleared of any health conflicts with using the drug and have reviewed other treatment options before agreeing to buprenorphine treatment.</td>

In most cases, alcohol consumption is permitted at the residence, either in a person's room or in common areas, while drug use is not tolerated on-site but residents can use drugs away from the building. Both are contrasted to "dry" housing where residences are alcohol and drug-free. In most cases, residents in these facilities are formerly homeless and have undergone numerous failed attempts at treatment for alcohol and/or drug use. Without this harm reduction alternative, homeless people with chronic substance use issues sleep on the street and are at increased risk of exposure to adulterated or harmful substances, or depend on costly detoxification and scarce emergency shelter beds for housing.</td>

While CDFIs share a common mission, they have a variety of structures and development lending goals. There are six basic types of CDFIs. Community development credit unions and community development banks supply underserved communities with traditional retail banking services like savings accounts and personal loans. Microenterprise development loan funds provide small amounts of business capital to small scale entrepreneurs. Community development loan funds lend to build businesses, affordable housing and community facilities. Community development venture capital funds provide equity and management expertise to small, often minority owned businesses that promise rapid growth. The ripple effects of CDFI activity bring responsible homeowners, locally-owned businesses, neighborhood facilities, first-time savers, and other positive benefits to communities that reach far beyond the financial bottom line.</td>

The approval process generally involves several stages:  a pre-application conference during which the municipality’s code enforcement staff familiarizes the developer with the local development regulations (including impact fees, dedication of land and required infrastructure improvements), reviews a sketch drawing of the proposed project and identifies any potential problems that the proposed subdivision may cause to either public infrastructure systems or other developments; submission and review of a preliminary legal plat (a subdivision map with approximate scale and dimensions); completion of required infrastructure improvements (e.g., roads and sewer and water connections to each lot within the subdivision); and submission, approval and recording of the final plat. The developer generally has the option of securing the required improvements by bond to guarantee their construction. After the subdivision is recorded, individual lots may be sold to different property owners, who then submit a site plan for their proposed project. Site plans may also be submitted by the developer and approval secured prior to a sale. The final step in the process is formal acceptance of the infrastructure improvements by the jurisdiction when all of the required improvements have been made and accepted.</td>

Tsunami wave activity is virtually imperceptible in the open ocean but tremendously destructive when it reaches shore, potentially stripping beaches of sand, undermining trees and other coastal vegetation and moving inland hundreds of feet, crushing boats, homes and other coastal structures in its wake.  At some locations, the advancing turbulent front may be the most destructive part of the wave; at others the greatest damage may be caused by the outflow of water back to sea.</td>

A tsunami is a series of ocean waves generated by the sudden displacement of large volumes of water by thrust-type submarine earthquakes, submarine volcanic eruptions, meteor impact, or coastal landslides. Tsunami wave activity is virtually imperceptible in the open ocean but tremendously destructive when it reaches shore, potentially stripping beaches of sand, undermining trees and other coastal vegetation and moving inland hundreds of feet, crushing  boats, homes and other coastal structures in its wake.  At some locations, the advancing turbulent front may be the most destructive part of the wave; at others the greatest damage may be caused by the outflow of water back to sea.</td>

Systolic heart failure happens when the heart's ability to pump blood decreases. The heart cannot push enough blood into the circulatory system, causing blood coming into the heart from the lungs to back up and leak fluid into the lungs (pulmonary congestion). Diastolic heart failure occurs when the heart has trouble relaxing or resting. The heart muscle becomes stiff and cannot fill with blood, causing fluid buildup (most often in the feet, ankles, and legs) and lung congestion. Heart failure develops slowly over time and can have a large impact on a person's life and ability to perform daily activities of living, such as dressing, bathing, and getting around.</td>

People can be exposed to mercury by eating fish contaminated with methylmercury (an organic compound that is created when mercury combines with carbon); breathing vapors in air from spills, incinerators and industries that burn mercury-containing fuels; release of mercury from dental work and medical treatments; breathing contaminated workplace air or skin contact during use in the workplace (dental, health services, chemical and other industries that use mercury); and practicing rituals that include mercury. The effects of exposure to any hazardous substance, including mercury, depend on the dose, the duration, how the individual was exposed, personal traits and habits, and whether other chemicals are present. Exposure to high levels of metallic, inorganic, or organic mercury can permanently damage the brain, kidneys and developing fetus. Effects on brain functioning may result in irritability, shyness, tremors, changes in vision or hearing, and memory problems. Short-term exposure to high levels of metallic mercury vapors may cause effects including lung damage, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, increases in blood pressure or heart rate, skin rashes, and eye irritation.

Duchenne MD primarily affects boys and is the result of mutations in the gene that regulates dystrophin, a protein involved in maintaining the integrity of muscle fiber. Onset is between three to five years and progresses rapidly. Most boys become unable to walk at age 12, and by age 20 have to use a respirator to breathe. Facioscapulohumeral MD appears in adolescence and causes progressive weakness in facial muscles and certain muscles in the arms and legs. It progresses slowly and can vary in symptoms from mild to disabling. Myotonic MD varies in the age of onset and is characterized by myotonia (prolonged muscle spasm) in the fingers and facial muscles; a floppy-footed, high-stepping gait; cataracts; cardiac abnormalities; and endocrine disturbances. Individuals with myotonic MD have long faces and drooping eyelids; men have frontal baldness.</td>

Symptoms include floppy limbs and trunk, feeble movements of the arms and legs, swallowing difficulties, a weak sucking reflex, and impaired breathing. Type II (also known as juvenile SMA, intermediate SMA, or chronic SMA), has an onset between 6 and 18 months. Legs tend to be more impaired than arms. Children with Type II are usually able to sit without support if placed in position. Some may be able to stand or walk with help. Type III (also called Wolhlfart-Kugelberg-Welander disease, or mild SMA) can begin as early as the toddler years or as late as adolescence. Children can stand alone and walk, but may have difficulty getting up from a sitting position.

GBS disease is the most common cause of blood infections and meningitis in newborns and is often associated with newborn pneumonia.  In pregnant women, GBS causes urinary tract infections, postpartum endometritis, bacteremia and wound infections complicating cesarean sections.  Among men and among women who are not pregnant, GBS is associated with blood infections, skin or soft tissue infections and pneumonia.</td>

Two of the most severe forms of the disease are necrotizing fasciitis, a destructive infection of the muscle and fat tissue and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome, a rapidly progressing infection which causes shock and injury to the internal organs such as the kidneys, liver and lungs. Symptoms of necrotizing fasciitis include fever, severe pain and swelling, and redness at the wound site. Symptoms of streptococcal toxic shock syndrome include fever, dizziness, confusion, diffuse red rash and abdominal pain.</td>

A Port Wine Stain (PWS) is a vascular capillary malformation birthmark, varying in color from light pink to deep purple, that is caused by an overabundance of capillaries just beneath the surface of the skin. When a PWS covers the first and second trigeminal nerve distribution (the eye and forehead region of the face), the presence of Sturge-Weber Syndrome (SWS) is probable. A Port Wine Stain is not the only indicator of SWS and the syndrome can exist without the presence of a detectable Port Wine Stain. A related condition is Klippel-Trenaunay Syndrome (KTS), a congenital vascular disorder of unknown cause that is characterized by a Port Wine Stain, vascular anomalies, blood in the urine, rectal bleeding, vaginal bleeding or bleeding from an abnormal lesion on an affected limb.</td>

Marburg HF is caused by the Marburg virus, a genetically unique animal-borne RNA virus of the filovirus family. It is unknown how Marburg virus first transmits from its animal host to humans, but in at least one instance, unprotected contact with infected bat feces or aerosols were the most likely routes of infection. After the initial crossover of the virus from host animal to humans, transmission occurs through person-to-person contact. This may happen through direct contact to droplets of body fluids from infected persons, or contact with equipment and other objects contaminated with infectious blood or tissues. After an incubation period of 5-10 days, symptom onset is sudden and marked by fever, chills, headache and myalgia. Around the fifth day after the onset of symptoms, a maculopapular rash, most prominent on the trunk (chest, back, stomach), may occur. Nausea, vomiting, chest pain, a sore throat, abdominal pain and diarrhea may then appear. Symptoms become increasingly severe and can include jaundice, inflammation of the pancreas, severe weight loss, delirium, shock, liver failure, massive hemorrhaging and multi-organ dysfunction. There is no specific treatment for Marburg hemorrhagic fever. Supportive hospital therapy should be utilized, which includes balancing the patient's fluids and electrolytes, maintaining oxygen status and blood pressure, replacing lost blood and clotting factors, and treatment for any complicating infections. The reservoir host of Marburg virus is the African fruit bat.</td>

            <td valign="top">Individuals who use trucks to pick up and deliver goods which may be anything from automobiles to canned foods. Firms of all kinds rely on trucks for the pickup and delivery of goods because no other form of transportation can deliver goods door to door. Even if goods travel in part by ship, train or airplane, trucks carry nearly all goods at some point in their journey from producer to consumer. Heavy truck and tractor-trailer drivers drive trucks or vans with a capacity of at least 26,000 pounds Gross Vehicle Weight (GVW). They transport goods including cars, livestock and other materials in liquid, loose or packaged form. Many routes are from city to city and cover long distances. Some companies use two drivers on very long runs; one drives while the other sleeps in a berth behind the cab. "Sleeper" runs may last for days or even weeks, usually with the truck stopping only for fuel, food, loading and unloading. Light or delivery services truck drivers drive trucks or vans with a capacity under 26,000 pounds GVW. They deliver or pick up merchandise and packages within a specific area and usually load and unload the merchandise at the customer's place of business.</td>
