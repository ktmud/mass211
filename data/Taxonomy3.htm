The gardens provide an opportunity for participants to savor the freshness, flavor and wholesomeness of home-grown produce; save money on their food bills; grow traditional foods not available in the supermarket; or simply get some exercise and enjoy the benefits of being outdoors. They also support a community's food security, contribute to the preservation of open space, strengthen community bonds, provide a sense of connection to the environment and offer opportunities for community education.</td>

The loans help borrowers refinance their mortgage into a payment they can afford, modify the terms and conditions of their current loan or reinstate a delinquent loan; and may involve a reduction in principal if the lending institution is willing to write down the loan or a reduction in the balance in a second lien in some situations. Some loans may be forgiven after a designated number of years or only become due and payable if the property is sold, refinanced or no longer owner-occupied. Most of these programs are time limited and apply only to primary residences. Applicant homeowners may be required to prove economic hardship and demonstrate that they meet income and other guidelines.</td>

Residents own the leasehold interest in the unit, but not the unit itself. Life lease units are generally priced lower than comparable market rate housing options and owners pay a monthly fee to cover expenses such as maintenance and management. A life lease can be for the life of the tenant or for a specific term (e.g. 50 years), and some have no specified termination date. The majority of life lease communities are developed and owned by nonprofit organizations, charitable groups, service clubs or religious institutions. When a resident leaves or passes away, the lease can usually be sold to someone on the sponsor's waiting list or on the open market, or transferred back to the development's sponsoring organization. Some life lease agreements permit the interest to be passed to the resident's family through their will. Conditions of this right of transfer are determined by the organization that establishes the life lease project. Most sponsors, in consultation with the residents, restrict who can live in the building (e.g., a minimum age of 55) to ensure that the integrity of the community is maintained. Some properties, particularly those that target people with moderate and low incomes, have maximum income level limits and/or limits on total assets.</td>

Some programs require that the individual/family be transitioning from a short-term emergency shelter. The length of stay varies considerably by program. It is generally longer than two weeks but typically 60 days or more and, in many cases, up to two years or more. The supportive services may be provided directly by the organization managing the housing or may be coordinated by them and provided by other public or private agencies. Transitional housing/shelter is generally provided in apartment style facilities with a higher degree of privacy than short-term homeless shelters; may be provided at no cost to the resident; and may be configured for specialized groups within the homeless population such as people with substance abuse problems, homeless mentally ill, homeless domestic violence victims, veterans or homeless people with AIDS/HIV. In some cases, a "transition in place" option allows families to continue living in the same complex (if not the same unit) where their transitional housing unit is located when they are ready to move to permanent housing. In other cases, the permanent housing option is either public housing or private rental housing supported by a tenant-based voucher subsidy. Included are post-domestic violence shelter housing programs that make affordable rental housing (or other accommodations) available to women, generally those who are coming directly out of a domestic violence shelter or other crisis shelter, often in apartment complexes owned by the shelter; and programs that provide transitional housing and support services for other targeted groups such as military and veteran families and others who need a temporary supportive living environment to maintain stability and begin to thrive.</td>

Defendants convicted of less serious crimes may be sentenced to simple probation, i.e., supervision in the community under the direction of a probation officer. For other crimes, a judge may choose from three intermediate sanctions: community confinement, intermittent confinement, and home detention. For more serious crimes, judges may impose a split sentence, in which the defendant spends a short time in prison and the remainder of the sentence in one of the intermediate sanctions. Community confinement means residence in a treatment center outside the prison walls, such as a halfway house or drug rehabilitation center. Community confinement may be imposed instead of prison time, or as a means of easing transition back into the community after time spent in prison. Intermittent confinement means the defendant is free to go to work or live at home for part of the week, but must spend time in jail on weekends. Home confinement is a judicially managed system of punishment and control for offenders deemed safe enough to live in their own homes, but requiring a higher degree of supervision.</td>

Residents may be permitted to leave for work, school, or treatment, but are otherwise restricted to the facility. Specific privileges and restrictions depend on the population served. Residence in a community based correctional facility may be imposed as a "stand alone" sentence by the courts, be a condition of supervised release for intermittent confinements or split sentences (a term of imprisonment followed by other, less restrictive sanctions), be used to tighten restrictions on offenders who have violated the conditions of their probation/parole, or provide a transitional setting for offenders selected for placement by a correctional institution at the end of their sentence.

Also included are law enforcement and prevention efforts that focus on the sources of demand for trafficked services; development of responsive and culturally competent trafficking intervention systems that people can trust; and other activities that support the rights and address the needs of trafficking victims, penalize and impede the activities of perpetrators and motivate the community to become involved in the issue.</td>

Identity theft occurs when someone fraudulently obtains private information about an individual, e.g., his or her Social Security number, uses it to apply for credit in that person's name, runs up large bills and then disappears without paying the bills leaving the victim with ruined credit. Identity thieves may also purchase expensive medical services in the victim's name or give the victim's name and personal information to a law enforcement officer during an investigation or upon arrest leaving the individual vulnerable to large medical bills or subject to arrest.</td>

The term "condemnation proceedings" is used to describe the formal act of the exercise of the power of eminent domain to transfer title to the property from its private owner to the government. The property is taken either for government use or by delegation to third parties who will devote it to public or civic use or, in some cases, to economic development. The most common uses of property taken by eminent domain are for public utilities, highways and railroads; however it may also be used for other purposes such as mitigation of a blighted area, remediation of an environmentally contaminated area, reduction of abandoned property, or removal of a public nuisance. Some jurisdictions require that the government body offer to purchase the property before resorting to the use of eminent domain.</td>

The latter situation can arise in a variety of ways. The government might, for example, engage in conduct that destroys the landowner's ability to use and enjoy the property, such as by building an airstrip next to the property and flying planes over it, or cutting off or polluting the flow of water to the land. The government might also obstruct the landowner's access to the property with water or debris, as where dynamiting operations block the road to the landowner's property.</td>

At the federal level, the president has the power to grant a pardon, and at the state level the governor or a pardon board made up of high-ranking state officials may grant one. Full pardons are unconditional whereas other forms (commutations, conditional pardons, remissions and reprieves) are used to mitigate the individual's sentence. In the case of amnesty, the government grants an act of oblivion officially overlooking designated offenses, especially political offenses against a government, e.g., being in the country illegally, possessing contraband, being guilty of tax evasion. Amnesty generally occurs by statute under which convictions related to specified criminal offenses are erased and prosecutions are canceled. Unlike pardons, which apply to specific individuals, amnesty legislation applies to groups of people who fulfill the conditions or description laid down by the law. Amnesties do not erase a criminal act, condone or forgive it. They enable political reconciliation.</td>

Child support assistance/enforcement may be provided by private attorneys, legal clinics, family law facilitators' offices or child support enforcement programs which are available in all states, often as a component of the district attorney's office.</td>

Applicants are generally referred to the U.S. Refugee Program (USRP) by officials of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) or by a U.S. Embassy or Consulate, and are interviewed by officials in one of the three U.S. Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Service (CIS) overseas offices to determine their eligibility for resettlement. Nongovernmental processing agencies are responsible for preparation and casework relative to individual applications. They conduct interviews, help prepare the applications for the CIS, arrange for medical examinations and background checks for those refugees who are approved and obtain information about individuals/families that is relevant to determining the best settlement arrangements. A limited number of refugees are resettled in the U.S. each year.</td>

While, generally speaking, a person who is already in the United States cannot be expelled without first going through a removal hearing, someone arriving at the border or a port of entry can be forced to leave without review by a judge. Those who are removed are barred from returning to the U.S. for at least 10 years unless the Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services (CIS) grants a special waiver. Organizations involved in these proceedings include the Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services, the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Immigration Court and the Board of Immigration Appeals.</td>

Native American law attorneys are found in federal government bodies such as the Bureau of Indian Affairs and The Indian Claims Commission, which hears and determines claims against the United States on behalf of any Indian tribe. Private law firms also have lawyers who specialize in matters relating to Indian lands and reservations, tribal rights and other legal issues affecting Native Americans. Specific Indian tribes, which are recognized as sovereign entities with the power to regulate their internal and social organization, have lawyers who may be members of the tribe themselves, and/or lawyers who are hired as "general counsel" to handle the legal affairs of their tribe. Public service agencies also serve the Native American community with lawyers who specialize in the Indian Child Welfare Act, and others who serve children, people who are elderly, or indigent members of the Native American community.</td>

In some states, conservatorships are voluntary arrangements in which a physically infirm but competent individual petitions the court to appoint the conservator of choice to manage whatever powers and property the conservatee chooses to include in the arrangement. In these jurisdictions, guardianships apply to adults who are found to be incompetent. In other states, conservatorships apply only to an individual's property while guardianships address responsibility for the person.

The EPO can order the abuser not to contact the victim, to stay away from the victim, and to move out of the victim's home immediately until the order expires. The EPO can also award temporary care and custody of any affected children.

Besides tabulating the number of acute occupational pesticide-related cases, these surveillance systems perform in-depth investigations for case confirmation, and develop preventive interventions aimed at particular industries or pesticide hazards. The program is most useful for timely identification of outbreaks and emerging pesticide problems.</td>

They have to be transported to and from the cells by special carriers called lipoproteins including low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL). High levels of LDL cholesterol can build up in the walls of the arteries that feed the heart and the brain and form plaque, a thick hard substance that can clog the arteries. HDL tends to carry cholesterol away from the arteries back to the liver where it is passed from the body. Triglycerides are the chemical form in which most fat exists in food as well as in the body. They are also present in blood plasma and, in association with cholesterol, form the plasma lipids.</td>

Others include an ultrasound test which measures bone density in the heel, wrist or forearm; the SXA scan (single energy x-ray absorptiometry) which measures the wrist or heel; the PDXA scan (peripheral dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry) which measures the wrist, heel or finger; RA (radiographic x-ray absorptiometry) which measures the hand; DPA (dual photon x-ray absorptiometry) which measures the spine, hip or total body; SPA (single photon x-ray absorptiometry) which measures the wrist; and QCT (quantitative computed tomography) which measures the spine or hip. Although all bones of the skeleton will reflect osteoporosis to some extent, bone density studies of the spine and hip may detect bone loss earlier. Peripheral bone measurements are accurate enough to be used as screening tools but not as precise as the DEXA test which is often recommended if the results of screening procedures indicate that further testing is warranted.

            <td valign="top">Programs that offer therapeutic interventions for children and adults with autism spectrum disorders that are based on the theory of applied behavior analysis that behavior rewarded is more likely to be repeated than behavior ignored. The therapy is designed to teach skills, from basic ones such as sleeping and dressing to more involved ones such as social interaction, but is also used to correct inappropriate repetitive, aggressive and/or dangerous behaviors that are associated with autism. Skills are broken down into small steps and taught one simple step at a time. When a task has been successfully completed, a reward is offered, reinforcing the behavior or task. Also available are intensive ABA programs in which children and adults with autism may work for 30 to 40 hours a week, one-on-one with a trained professional.</td>

Children attend two 30-minute sessions per day for a 10- to 12-day period and listen through headphones to music that has been altered by a filtering apparatus to emphasize some tones and reduce the intensity of others. The treatment is modified to suit individual needs as determined by special auditory testing. The technique was developed by Dr. Guy Berard, an otolaryngologist (ear, nose and throat specialist) in Annecy, France. It is used primarily for individuals with autism spectrum disorders but on occasion it has been used to treat people with behavioral disorders and other types of disabilities. Also included are other types of AIT such as Tomatis, The Listening Program and Integrated Listening Systems (iLs).</td>

Greenspan describes six stages of emotional development that children meet to develop a foundation for more advanced learning, a developmental ladder that children with autism may have difficulty climbing. Through the use of Floor Time, parents and educators can follow the child's lead and build on what the child does to encourage more interactions. Floor Time does not treat the child with autism in separate pieces for speech development or motor development but rather addresses the child's emotional development. It is frequently used for a child's daily playtime in conjunction with other methods.</td>

The underlying motivational strategies of PRT are incorporated as often as possible and include child choice, task variation, interspersing maintenance tasks, rewarding attempts and the use of direct and natural reinforcers (e.g., giving the child a stuffed animal when the child requests the stuffed animal). PRT is used to teach language; decrease disruptive/self-stimulating behaviors; and increase social, communication and academic skills.</td>

The program's core philosophy is that individuals with autism can participate in authentic emotional relationships if they are exposed to them in a gradual, systematic way. RDI seeks to cultivate the building blocks of social connection – such as referencing, emotion sharing, coregulation and experience sharing – that normally develop in infancy and early childhood. It is a family-based program in which trained consultants support families to alter their interaction and communication styles. There is a period of parent education, followed by an assessment of both the child and the child-parent relationship. After that, consultants support the family through a set of specific objectives to build a "guided participation" relationship between parents and child that will allow the child to once again become a "cognitive apprentice" to the parents. Once the cognitive apprenticeship is in place, the family can move on to specific cognitive remediation objectives for the child. These are developmentally staged objectives designed to restore optimal neural connectivity through a series of "discoveries" and "elaborations".</td>

The stories typically have three sentence types: descriptive sentences addressing the where, who, what and why of the situation; perspective sentences that provide some understanding of the thoughts and emotions of others; and directive sentences that suggest a response. The stories can be developed by anyone, are specific to the child's needs, and are written in the first person, present tense.

Eligibility factors include people's age, whether they are pregnant, have a disability, are blind, or aged; their income and resources (like bank accounts, real property or other items that can be sold for cash); and whether they are U.S. citizens or lawfully admitted immigrants. Families who are receiving benefits through TANF and individuals who receive SSI as aged, blind and disabled are categorically eligible groups. The rules for counting a person's income and resources vary from state to state and from group to group. There are special rules for those who live in nursing homes, for people served under the Medicaid Waiver program, for people served by Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE) programs and for children with disabilities living at home. Medicaid makes payments directly to a person's health care provider; and some recipients may be asked to pay a small part of the cost (co-payment) for some medical services. Most states have additional "state-only" programs to provide medical assistance for specified low-income persons who do not qualify for the Medicaid program.</td>

In many cases, parental rights are transferred to an adoption agency rather than directly to new adoptive parents so that the agency can maintain the level of confidentiality and privacy that the parties desire and have agreed to in the adoption. The agency passes the parental rights to the adopting parents. Laws governing consent and relinquishment vary by jurisdiction. In some areas, relinquishment is a judicial process, taking place in court; in others, papers can be signed in front of agency representatives, a notary, or other designated person. Other differences include whether relinquishment terminates parental rights or is just part of the process, whether relinquishment papers can be signed prior to the birth of the child or within a specified time following birth, the conditions under which relinquishment can be revoked, and the conditions under which a pending adoption may be interrupted beyond the time allowed for revocation. The term "relinquishment" also applies to the document that birth parents sign as part of the relinquishment process.</td>

Services include observation and assessment, home visits, child care site visits, behavior management strategies for the child care setting and the home, adaptations in the child care environment, team planning and community referrals, and staff training. The programs differ from community to community in a number of ways including the type of services provided (behavioral-oriented versus therapy-oriented), the credentials of professionals providing the service (licensed therapists, behaviorists, early childhood specialists/educators), and the degree to which they work individually with children and families. They are generally implemented within a collaborative relationship between local community mental health agencies and local/regional child care resource and referral association offices, though other organizations may also be involved.</td>

If successful, children can safely remain with or return to a family member or, possibly, their parents, rather than be placed for adoption or have some other permanent goal established for them. Typically a case worker meets with immediate family members to identify the larger family unit to participate in the process, and a neutral coordinator works with the family as they discuss issues and options. Then the family works privately to develop a plan of action. People involved in the process may include parents, grandparents, other kin, children, tribal elders (where relevant) and individuals whom the family considers to be supportive (e.g., neighbors, clergy). In most instances, families participate in family group conferencing on a voluntary basis, though in a few locations, meetings are court-ordered. In some areas, the practice is also being used in juvenile justice and TANF cases.</td>

The Wraparound facilitator coordinates team meetings and ensures the team identifies and prioritizes goals, provides crisis and safety planning, and tracks the family's progress towards goal attainment.  The family is prepared and supported as they transition from formal services to independence.

Included are programs for individuals who are proficient in American Sign Language (ASL), Quebec Sign Language (LSQ) as well as those who use systems like Signed Exact English (SEE), Conceptually Accurate Signed English (CASE) which involve manually coded English, signed French which involve manually coded French, cued speech in which words spoken by lips are supplemented by cues which aid speech reading, and oral transliteration in which words spoken by an individual are silently mouthed to the deaf person accompanied by appropriate facial expressions and gestures to facilitate conveyance of the information. Sign language interpreters interpret in two ways: voice-to-sign and sign-to-voice. Voice-to-sign means the interpreter is signing to the deaf person what the speaker is saying. Sign-to-voice means the interpreter is voicing to the hearing person what the deaf person is signing. Some individuals want an interpreter who can perform both roles. Others prefer to speak for themselves and limit the interpreter's role to signing to them.</td>

            <td valign="top">Programs that allow people who are deaf, hard of hearing or have speech impairments to communicate through a communications assistant with people who use a standard telephone or the Internet. The communications assistant relays TTY (text telephone or telecommunications device for deaf and hard of hearing individuals) to the telephone user and types that person's response back to the TTY user. Three options when using a telephone relay service are voice carry-over (VCO), hearing carry-over (HCO) and speech-to-speech (STS).  VCO allows a person with a hearing impairment to speak directly to the other party and then read the response typed by a communications assistant. HCO allows a person with a speech impairment to hear the other party and relay the TTY response back to the telephone user through the communications assistant. STS provides assistance for people with speech disabilities who have difficulty being understood on the phone. STS communications assistants are specially trained in understanding a variety of speech disorders, which enables them to repeat what the caller says in a manner that makes the caller’s words clear and understandable to the called party. The relay service allows individuals with communication disorders to communicate with all telephone users. Telecommunication relay services can be reached by dialing 711. </td>

In addition to idiomatic language translation, local details such currency, national regulations and holidays, cultural sensitivities, product or service names, gender roles, geographic references and other similar details must be considered. Products need to be globalized before they can be localized for specific languages and cultures, a process which prepares the product for localization by taking steps that make the text easier to translate, e.g., adopting a consistent writing style, standard terminology and controlled grammar rules; using written examples that have global meaning; planning the layout of graphics to accommodate text that is read from right to left as well as left to right; and allowing space in user interfaces (e.g., hardware labels, help pages, online menus) for translation into languages that require more space. A well-globalized product is one that has been enabled at a technical level for localization.</td>

Training is routinely available to military service members to help them achieve and sustain personal readiness, foster an environment of trust, and optimize human performance in environments of uncertainty and persistent danger and to military spouses to address the unique challenges they may face during pre- and post-deployment, but also to individuals in the civilian sector.</td>

Treatment  involves individual therapy, a skills group, telephone contact and therapist consultation. The group skills training has four modules:  core mindfulness skills, interpersonal effectiveness skills, emotion regulation skills and distress tolerance skills. The  focus of the group sessions is on learning and practicing adaptive skills that are particularly relevant to the problems experienced by people with BPD. While originally developed for this population, dialectical behavior therapy has been used with people who have other types of emotional disorders.</td>

Psychoanalysis as a therapy attempts to overcome repressions, often by exploring their origins in childhood in order to release energy for healthy, normal living. Psychoanalysts accomplish this largely by means of free association, dream analysis and working through transference issues over time to overcome resistance and get at the sources of the unconscious impulses. Psychoanalytic psychotherapists accomplish the same objective through utilization of more directive interpretation and a face-to-face therapeutic setting, and focus on the relationship of present behavior to childhood patterns rather than utilize free association.</td>

Each person has an innate need for strokes and will design a life script which is based on early beliefs about oneself and others.  These existential beliefs are reinforced when the person engages in repetitive, stereotyped games with others in which they play roles to obtain strokes: the Critical Parent, the Nurturing Parent, the Free Child, the Adapted Child, the Adult.

Counseling for those who bully generally focuses on helping them understand the impact their hurtful behavior has on others, explore reasons for why they bully, learn new skills for communicating positively with others, and address personal experiences that may contribute to their bullying behavior. Bullying can be defined as intentional, repeated, hurtful acts such as name-calling, threatening or shunning inflicted by one or more persons whose power may come from physical strength, age, financial status, popularity, social status or by association (the people they know, who their family is). Harmful bullying can also occur quietly and covertly, through gossip or postings on the Internet; and while most frequently occurring at school, can also happen in the workplace or other settings.</td>

            <td valign="top">Medication assisted treatment (MAT) programs that use buprenorphin to help people with an opioid use disorder abstain from or reduce their use of opioids (usually heroin or painkillers such as oxycondin or morphine). Buprenorphine produces a weaker version of effects (including euphoria and respiratory depression) that are associated with full drugs such as heroin and methadone. The effects increase with each dose until at moderate doses they level off, lowering the risk of misuse, dependency and side effects. Treatment occurs in three phases: a medically monitored start-up phase when the patient is in early stages of withdrawal; a stabilization phase after a patient has discontinued or greatly reduced their misuse of the problem drug, no longer has cravings, and experiences few, if any, side effects; and a maintenance phase when a patient is doing well on a steady dose of buprenorphine. The length of time of the maintenance phase is tailored to each patient and could be indefinite. Once an individual is stabilized, an alternative approach would be to go into a medically supervised withdrawal, which makes the transition from a physically dependent state smoother. People then can engage in further rehabilitation—with or without MAT—to prevent a possible relapse. Ideal candidates for opioid dependency treatment with buprenorphine have an opioid use disorder diagnosis, are willing to follow safety precautions for the treatment, have been cleared of any health conflicts with using the drug and have reviewed other treatment options before agreeing to buprenorphine treatment.</td>

Methadone works by changing how the brain and nervous system respond to pain. It lessens the painful symptoms of opiate withdrawal and blocks the euphoric effects of opiate drugs such as heroin, morphine, and codeine, as well as semi-synthetic opioids like oxycodone and hydrocodone. Methadone is offered in pill, liquid, and wafer forms and is taken once a day. Pain relief from a dose of methadone lasts about four to eight hours. Patients taking methadone to treat opioid addiction must receive the medication under the supervision of a physician. After a period of stability (based on progress and proven, consistent compliance with the medication dosage), patients may be allowed to take methadone at home between program visits. The length of time in methadone treatment varies from person to person but should be at least 12 months; and treatment must be stopped gradually to prevent withdrawal. The decision to stop treatment needs to be supervised by a physician.</td>

TDR programs are enabled by a local or regional ordinance that creates "sending areas" (to be preserved) and "receiving areas" which have increased densities. Developers purchase the development rights from the sending area and use them to increase existing or planned densities in the receiving areas. TDR programs have been most successful in areas that have very limited open space opportunities and the community is collectively motivated to keep what open space is left.</td>

The local zoning ordinance specifies those uses for which a conditional use permit may be requested, which zones they may be requested in, and the public hearing procedure. CUPs do not constitute a zoning change. Variances are limited waivers from the property development standards of the zoning ordinance, e.g., setback requirements, but do not allow a change in land use. </td>

The camera system continuously monitors the traffic signal, and the camera is triggered when any vehicle passes over the sensors faster than a preset minimum speed and at a specified elapsed time after the signal has turned red. A second photograph is taken that shows the violator in the intersection. The camera records the date, time of day, time elapsed since the beginning of the red signal, and the speed of the vehicle. The use of a flash produces clear images under a wide range of light and weather conditions. Speed limit enforcement cameras are installed at fixed locations along stretches of freeway/expressway where violations frequently occur and can be set to photograph drivers who are moving faster than a specified speed. Upon review of photographic evidence and depending on state law requirements, tickets are issued by mail to either vehicle owners or to drivers at the time of the offense.</td>
